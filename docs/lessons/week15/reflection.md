# Week 15 Reflection

This week started out really fun. Implementing computer vision and text recognition on the Raspberry Pi went pretty smoothly and I enjoyed learning about it. However, working with the Pico was the opposite. I ran into problem after problem and after hours of trying solutions, I was seemingly stuck without any way to overcome image parsing limitations. However, GPT-4o released the day before I was set to present on our weekly classes, and luckily let me find a way to implement text recognition on a Pico and salvage a lot of my efforts.
