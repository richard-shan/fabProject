# Casting

I first opened up all of the design files that I had to determine the inches cubed of material I would need to cast all of my designs. I then converted cubic inches to milliliters, determining that I needed about 150mL of material.

Before filling my molds, I sprayed mold release onto the molds. This ensures that after the cast solidifies, the mold and cast separate easily.

For my casting, I used Smooth-On Mold Star 15 Slow, which came with a Part A container and a Part B container. To produce 150mL of Mold Star, I mixed 75mL of Part A with 75mL of Part B.

I then poured the Mold Star onto each of my molds.

After the Mold Star solidified, I took them out from the molds. 

Here is the cast of the parakeet from the Prusa mold.

Because the wax I used for milling had imperfections, the heart cast had some bubbles along the edges.

I used an exacto-knife to manually cut away the bubbles. Here is what the final heart mold looks like.

My first cast on the resin mold didn't end up working because I mixed the Part A and Part B solutions inproperly. The cast ended up having bubbles in it and wasn't very solidified, even after settling overnight.

I then re-cast the resin mold with a properly mixed solution. Here is the final parakeet from the resin mold.
