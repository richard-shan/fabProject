# Week 12 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials, then make and compare test casts with each of them, along with comparing printing vs machining molds.

My full documentation for this project can be found <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week12a/">**here**</a>.

## Individual Contribution

I was responsible for comparing the information on the datasheets, comparing applications, comparing 3D printing and machining for producing molds, along with documenting my work.
