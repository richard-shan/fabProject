# Exploring 3D CAD Programs

For this week's assignment, I designed and modelled the frame for the box in my final project. I used 3 different CAD softwares to get a feel for each of them and decide which one I liked best. For each of the CAD programs that I explored, I modelled the same part as to highlight the key differences between them.

## Autodesk Fusion

<code>Fusion360 has recently been renamed to Autodesk Fusion. No features are affected.</code>

I decided to first model my design in Fusion360, as I had prior experience working with Fusion and was pretty comfortable using it. When I started out with Autodesk Fusion, Kevin Kennedy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr">**Fusion tutorials**</a> were a massive help.

I first started off with a rectangular prism to act as the main body of the design.

Next, I filleted the box to round out the edges.

I then created a sketch on the top of the box, where I created six circles. These 6 circles represent the holes where I will put metal pins into that can pop up and down depending on what needs to be represented.

I extruded the circles downward as holes. This creates the actual space where the pins will be placed.

Finally, I used the pattern feature to repeat the sketch and extrusion across the top of the box. This created a total of 5 evenly spaced sets of 6 pins. With each set of 6 pins representing a single braille character, one iteration of pin setups can represent five letters.
