# 2D Modelling

## Gimp

I tried out Gimp for 2D modelling. Gimp is a primarily raster-based program, but represents path structures in vector format. To test out Gimp, I decided to edit a picture of a parakeet!

I first downloaded an image of a few parakeets from the internet.

<img src="../../../pics/week2/parakeets.jpg" alt="Original image" width="500"/>
</center>

I then used the "Fuzzy Select" tool in Gimp to select parts of the background. After repeatedly using the tool a few times, I had the original picture of the parakeets but this time with a transparent background.

Next, I used DALL-E to generate an image of a rainforest. I would use this image as the background of my edit.

<img src="../../../pics/week2/rainforest.jpg" alt="AI-Generated rainforest image" width="500"/>
</center>

To insert the background, I created a new layer under the transparent image in Gimp. Layering the background image underneath the parakeet layer means that the parakeets would show up on top of the background, and the rainforest would cover any transparent spots. I had some experience using a layering system due to previously using ProCreate.

After inserting the rainforest image into the background layer, I created the following final product:

## Conclusion

Gimp appears to be a very powerful editing tool, especially considering that it is completely free. Although I do not have much experience in graphic design (evidently), Gimp was intuitively designed and easy to use. The GUI itself is a little overwhelming, and navigating and using tools correctly is a little complex, but it is pretty easy to get used to. I will definitely use Gimp in the future for designing and editing images.
