# Gravity Sketch

As a supplement to CAD week, our Fab Lab provided us with the unique opportunity to try out Gravity Sketch, a program that allows for drawing and 3D modelling while in virtual reality (VR). We used the Oculus Quest 2 VR headsets for this. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a way to take screenshots while inside the headset, and thus cannot provide a picture of me testing out the designing space. However, I was able to create and print a file from the VR headset using the following steps:

1.	Launch GravitySketch from the Library of the Oculus Quest..
2.	Click "File Manager".
3.	Create your new sketch with the Plus button.
4.  Design your model. Use the right hand outer trigger to draw, the right hand inner trigger to grab, and the left hand buttons as a menu.
5.	After finishing your sketch, click the blue button on the left hand controller.
6.	Select the "Save and Export" on the menu that pops up.
7.  Click "Export".
8.	Name your file and select your export file type. Click the check mark. The file is now exported into LandingPad, the online storage software that GravitySketch uses.
9.	Open landing pad on your computer & download the exported file.
10.	You can then open the file from your computer. I exported the file from GravitySketch as an OBJ file, and was able to open it in PrusaSlicer where I printed the test design.


This 3D print is a small proof-of-concept cube that I designed entirely in VR.
