## Dissemination

I believe that my final project has the potential to significantly impact the accessibility of printed materials for visually impaired individuals. After Fab Academy, I will also attempt to shave off as much cost as possible from the device's production. Although I am not yet sure if I want to take this device to market, this will hopefully allow large-scale usage and/or production of the Box. As of now, the entire project is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.

## Future Development

I already have a couple of ideas that I want to implement in the future:

 - Add a button trigger for OCR
 - Power the ESP32CAM through a battery, making it wireless from the rest of the system
 - Design an in-air suspension case for the ESP32CAM to sit above books
 - Replace the Raspberry Pi with the Pico to decrease production cost (lots of difficult re-coding for memory purposes)
 - Modify the AI prompt to be able to describe images and scenes to the visually impaired
