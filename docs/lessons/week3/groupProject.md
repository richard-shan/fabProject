# Week 3 Group Project

## Group Assignment

For this week, our assignment as a group was to characterize our laser cutter's focus, power, speed, rate, kerf, joint clearance and types. 

The group's full documentation can be found on our <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week03a/">**Group Project Page**</a>.

## Individual Contribution

For this group project, I was responsible for testing the laser cutter's kerf, testing the laser cutter's power/frequency/speed, designing the test cutouts, testing the laser cutter's focus, and overall documentation.
