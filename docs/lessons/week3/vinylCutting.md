# Vinyl Cutting

## Idea

At the Charlotte Latin Fab Lab, each year every Fab student is expected to make a sticker that will be permanently displayed on a wall. The only requirement was that the sticker had to use multiple colors and be sufficiently complex. As an avid computer programmer, I decided to use make a sticker of the <a href="https://eclipseide.org/">**Eclipse IDE**</a> logo. To edit the image of the logo, I used use Gimp, a software that I was first introduced to in <a href="../../week2/2DModeling">**Week 2**</a>.

## Design

To begin designing my sticker, I had to dissect the logo into each different color. Based on the colors of vinyl that I had in the Lab, I decided to use three colors: gold, purple, and white. I first downloaded the logo from <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/artwork/">**Eclipse's Artwork Site**</a>.
