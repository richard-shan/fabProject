# Seeed Xiao RP2040

After milling the PCB board, it was time to solder on the components and test it out.

## Soldering

While soldering, I used the following references produced by <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/leon/students/adrian-torres/">**Adri√°n Torres**</a> and <a href="https://archive.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2016/charlottelatin/students/87/">**David Taylor**</a> respectively.

Before starting the soldering, I put a piece of kapton tape on the back of the chip so that the circuit would not short itself when it is plugged in.

I first aligned and soldered on the RP2040 chip. As the biggest component, I wanted to solder this on before any other parts.

Next, I soldered on the first blue LED at the top left, coming out of pin 26.

I then soldered on the 1k Ohm resistor for that LED.

I soldered on the button, along with 2 other resistors and an LED.

Next, I soldered on the Conn Header SMD 10POS 1.27mm, along with the final LED.

I then soldered on the remaining 2 resistors.

Finally, I soldered on the Conn Header SMD R/A 6POS 2.54mm.

## Software

### Selecting the Board

To download the required library for the Seeed Xiao 2040 chip, I had to add additional board URLs. I added the following URLs under the Additional Board URLs Manager in the Arduino IDE under File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager. Each line represents a different URL. In other words, the URLs are seperated by a newline space.

<pre><code class="language-none">https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json
</code></pre>

I was then able to select the correct board in the IDE.

### Programming

To test the circuit board, I wrote a simple program to blink all 3 LEDs that I sent to my fellow classmates.

<pre><code class="language-c++">void setup() {
  pinMode(1, OUTPUT); //bottom right LED
  pinMode(26, OUTPUT); //top left LED
  pinMode(0, OUTPUT); //bottom left LED
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(1, HIGH); //turns bottom right LED on
  digitalWrite(26, HIGH); //turns top left LED on
  digitalWrite(0, HIGH); //turns bottom left LED on
  
  delay(1000); //waits for 1 second

  digitalWrite(1, LOW); //turns bottom right LED off
  digitalWrite(26, LOW); //turns top left LED off
  digitalWrite(0, LOW); //turns bottom left LED off

  delay(1000); //waits for 1 second
}
</code></pre>

After uploading it, all of my LEDs worked without any issues!

### Port Selection Disabled

As I was trying out pushing more advanced programs onto the board, I encountered an issue where the "Port" selection button was grayed out and would not let me click into it.

I searched for a solution online and found that I needed to reinstall/update a driver for the chip. However, under my Windows 11 Device Manager panel, the device was unrecognized by my computer and I had to manually find a zip file online to use as a driver. After spending about an hour going down this rabbit hole, I eventually realized that I could have simply reset the board. I did this by holding down the bootload button (indicated with a capital B) and clicking the reset button (indicated by a capital R).

After resetting the board, the Port selection started working again and recognized the RP2040's UF2 bootloader.

</center>

I then selected the UF2 bootloader option. At this point, the chip will accept uploaded code. As such, I sent the blinking program (any program would suffice) and the code worked on the chip. After the code was compiled and uploaded, the Port selection fixed itself and returned to the usual COM port selection.
