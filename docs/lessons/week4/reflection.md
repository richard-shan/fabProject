# Week 4 Reflection

Overall, this week went pretty smoothly and wasn't very difficult. Although I hadn't used the milling machine much before, an engineering course that I was simultaneously enrolled in had covered milling a few weeks back and I was able to work from there. My board also worked on the first attempt and programming it was simple.
