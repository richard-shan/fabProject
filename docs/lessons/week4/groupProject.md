# Week 4 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to:

 - Characterize the design rules for your in-house PCB production process: document feeds, speeds, plunge rate, depth of cut (traces and outline) and tooling.
 - Document the workflow for sending a PCB to a board house
 - Document your work to the group work page and reflect on your individual page what you learned

The group's full documentation can be found on our <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week04c/">**Group Project Page**</a>.

## Individual Contribution

I was responsible for defining milling terms; designing the milling trace test; executing the milling trace test for the 1/16" bit, the 1/32" bit, and the 1/64" bit; characterization of the bits and their specifications; and documenting.
