# Cardboard Storage Box

Today, I cut and assembled a cardboard box to use for storage for components in the future. 

## Materials
The materials I used for assembling the cardboard box were all sourced from the lab.

- 1 sheet of cardboard
- Epilog Fusion Pro laser cutter
- Exacto Knife
- Hot Glue Gun

First, I downloaded the provided CDR file for the box design from Google Drive.

I then ran the file through the laser cutter and took out the cardboard.

This is the box after the cut. I folded in all the parts of the box to ensure that they assembled nicely, and scored some areas with an exacto knife.

I first imported a design into Silhouette Studio and traced it.

I then cut out the design and placed the sticker onto my box. Here is the completed box with the bird design and a sticker of my name:
