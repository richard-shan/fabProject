# Pen Turning

For my first woodworking project during Fab, I turned a pen from a kit containing 2 copper tubes, an ink cartridge, and a pen tip and cap. We were each given a bit of wood which we cut into the body of the pen. We then assembled the parts together. This was also my first time turning a pen so there were a few mishaps but overall, my final product turned out well!

## Materials
The materials used were all from the kit, with the exception of the wood and tools which came from the lab.

- 2 Copper Tubes
- 1 Ink Cartridge
- Pen Cap
- Pen Tip
- Pen Clip
- Lathe Machine
- Crusher
- Rotary Machine
- Laser Cutter

With the help of my instructor, I first cut the wood into rectangular prisms.

Next, I then used the lathe to drill a cylindrical hole inside the wood.

I then sanded the copper tubes which would hold the pen cartridge in order to rough them up a bit to give it more surface area when gluing. I then glued the tubes into the previously drilled hole inside the wood.

I then put the wood blocks on the lathe, pushing the rod through the copper tubes glued inside the wood. Then I used different tipped tools to chip away parts of the wood, first chipping away large chunks and eventually using a finer tipped tool to make small modifications.

After cutting the wood down to a thin cylindrical shape, I used sandpaper to smooth out the surface, starting with very rough sandpaper to remove some material and flatten the surface then using finer and finer grade sandpaper to create a very smooth surface.

After sanding the wood into a smooth surface, I applied a light spray of glue and accelerant as a final coating.

I then used the crusher to push the pen tip, clip, and cap together with the wood body and copper cores.

Here is what the pen looks like after finishing assembly:

# Pen Rotary Engraving


We used the rotary machine to engrave a cylindrical object inside the laser cutter. This was my first time using the rotary machine (along with my classmates and my instructor), so we spent a lot of time reading the manufacturer's instructions and figuring out the software.

I first cut a cylinder of wood to use as a test for the rotary machine and to figure out how it works.

    </tr>
</table>
<br> <br>

I then put the wood cylinder into the rotary machine inside of the laser cutter and did a trial print.

    </tr>
</table>
<br> <br>
After successfully completing the test run, I then put my pen into the rotary machine and ran an engraving on it.

However, I didn't realize that when importing the file to print, part of the text that was supposed to be engraved was actually off the page.

Because I didn't realize this until after taking the pen out of the laser cutter and seeing the botched print, I had a pen that was emblazoned with "ichard Shan". But as I didn't want to be stuck with a misspelled pen I decided to use an exacto-knife to manually engrave the "R" at the start.
