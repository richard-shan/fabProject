# Project Development

<b> Full documentation of the ideation, creation, and exposition of my final project can be found on my <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/students/richard-shan/lessons/final/">**Final Project Page**</a>. </b>

### Completed Tasks

I am almost ready to present my final project. All the core components are working:

 - ESP32CAM server
 - ESP32CAM custom endpoints and handlers
 - Raspberry Pi HTTP requests
 - Base64 encoding/decoding
 - TX/RX communication between ATTiny1614 and Raspberry Pi
 - OCR with GPT4o
 - Controllable solenoid toggling

### Remaining Tasks

While the bare-bones essentials of my project work, I have yet to fully integrate them together and package them. I still need to:

 - Create the solenoid case
 - Create the Raspberry Pi case
 - Assemble parts together
 - Ensure exterior looks nice

### Moving Forward

I am currently in the process of designing the solenoid case, which will take most of my time. The Raspberry Pi case in comparison is much simpler. Assembly should also be pretty easy, since I have already tested integrating key parts together with TX/RX and HTTP communication protocols. After everything is ready, I need to clean up the exterior, which should be pretty straightforward as I anticipate that all the guts of the project will fit inside the two cases. Finally, I need to create a video and slide for my project.
