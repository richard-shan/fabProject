## Scanning

As per recommendations from my instructors and previous years' Fab graduates, I used the app Polycam for my scanning. I decided to 3D scan a gaming microphone that was sitting in our lab.

To use Polycam to generate a 3D model, I then took around 60 photos of the microphone from a multitude of different angles around the mic. After uploading the photos to Polycam, it generated a GLB file which I could view and convert to other formats.

I then imported the .OBJ file into Fusion360, where I could view and modify the design.

As is shown in the scanned model, the actual design is very rough. While shapes are roughly preserved, there is a lot of background that is scanned and there is no geometry in the actual model. However, this was a cool skill to learn and I might try this out in the future on other objects.
