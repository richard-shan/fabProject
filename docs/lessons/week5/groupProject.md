# Week 5 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to test the design rules for our 3D printer (a Original Prusa MINI+ printer). Our full documentation can be found on our <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week05c/">**Group Project Page**</a>.

## Individual Contribution

I was responsible for defining terms, preparing the file for printing, troubleshooting printer connectivity issues, executing the print job, and documenting our work.
