# Week 9 Reflection

This week was pretty easy. Since I already had a board, all I had to figure out was how to get my chosen output device to work with it. I learned that I needed to modify my board a little bit but I did a proof of concept test with the servo through a breadboard. After this, I was able to quickly design a new board and produce it, which worked with the servo first try.
