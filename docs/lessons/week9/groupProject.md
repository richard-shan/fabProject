# Week 9 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to:

 - Measure the power consumption of an output device.
 - Document your work on the group work page and reflect on your individual page what you learned.

My full documentation for this project can be found <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week09a/">**here**</a>.

## Individual Contribution

I was responsible for designing and producing the PCB for the servo, measuring the voltage and current of the servo, researching how to find power consumption, and calculating the power consumption of the servo, along with documenting our work.
