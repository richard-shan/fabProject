# Week 6 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to:

- Browse through the datasheet for your microcontroller
- Compare the performance and development workflows for other architectures
- Document your work to the group work page and reflect on your individual page what you learned

My full documentation for this project can be found <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week06a/">**here**</a>.

## Individual Contribution

I was responsible for browsing the SAMD11C's datasheet, comparing the performance of the SAMD11C chip to that of the ATTINY412, comparing the development process of the SAMD11C to that of the ATTINY412, and documenting all our work.

Although we were assigned groups for the creation and programming of the SAMD11C chip, it is not technically part of the group project and thus its documentation, work distribution, and the like can be found on my individual site <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/students/richard-shan/lessons/week6/samd11c/">**here**</a>.
