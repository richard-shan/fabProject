# Week 7 Reflection

This week was pretty average in terms of difficulty. Learning how to use the Shopbot Alpha machine was a steep curve, but after I performed my first cut for my shelf, I was able to easily and confidently design new files and cut them for the group project tests. I had never used the large CNC machine before this week and I think learning how to use it adds a powerful tool to my arsenal. The hardest part of this week was using Aspire, as there were a lot of settings and hidden configurations that needed to be correct, and I spent most of my time stressing about these settings. I found that having a peer double check all of your settings is a good strategy.
