# Week 7 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to:

 - Complete your labâ€™s safety training
 - Test runout, alignment, fixturing, speeds, feeds, materials and toolpaths for your machine
 - Document your work to the group work page and reflect on your individual page what you learned

My full documentation for this project can be found <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/assignments/week07d/">**here**</a>.

## Individual Contribution
