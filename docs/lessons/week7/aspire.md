# Aspire Designing

I first opened up the DXF file that I exported from Fusion in Aspire. Here is the 2D view of the file after I slightly moved the design away from the edges.

After I was satisfied with the placement of my design, I started designing the CAM process and designing my toolpaths. I did this via the Toolpath menu of Aspire on the right hand side of the GUI. Here are the settings of the toolpath I created for the legs of my shelf.

The cutting depth of 0.45 inches means that the machine will cut 0.45 inches deep along the toolpath. I chose this value because my wood board is 0.45 inches thick. 

The 3/8" Compression Spiral tool was the bit that our Shopbot machine uses. My instructor provided the information for the tool so that we were able to modify the specifications of the tool on Aspire.

For the legs toolpath specifically, I chose the outside cutting setting. This means that the machine would cut on the outside of the component, meaning that the remaining material would be the exact size that I designed the leg. I also chose the outside setting for cutting the outside of my shelves, because I wanted to maintain the original dimensions. However, when I was cutting the internal cutouts of each shelf rack, I chose inside cutting because cutting on the inside in the middle of a shelf would create a hole to the same size that I intended. I was a little confused on why I would ever use the "On" cutting setting, and my instructors told me that I would only ever use this setting if the design was specifically made to be cut on directly.

Using the ```Edit Tabs``` button, I was able to manually select some spots that I wanted to add tabs on. Tabs are small bits of wood that are easily removed but hold the design to the rest of the board during cutting, so that the wood cutouts do not fly off and become a safety hazard immediately after they are cut out. The tabs are visible in the 3D render.
