# Week 10 Group Project

## Group Assignment
For this week, our assignment as a group was to:

 - Measure the power consumption of an output device.
 - Document your work on the group work page and reflect on your individual page what you learned.

## Individual Contribution

I was responsible for the entirety of our group's programming and software development, along with working with (and deciding upon) the Raspberry Pi. I also for selected, set up, and configured the microphone, keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen. I was also responsible for all of our software debugging and assisted in debugging the motors.
