# Week 1 Reflection

I effectively utilized my prior experience with Git, Python, and MkDocs to overcome common setup errors, and the entire process went relatively smoothly for me. The only new thing I worked with was setting up an SSH key, which was needed when working with GitLabs. The main issue I faced this week was getting GitLabs and MkDocs to work together properly, which I solved by downloading a preset yml file from the Fab Academy Student Template. I also setup the directory system that I would use for documentation in way that had clear organization. Encountering the 10MB push limit now ensures that I would remember to scale down my files in the future. Additionally, the final project planning was really useful because I now knew what to focus on during later weeks.
