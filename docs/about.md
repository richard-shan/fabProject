# About Me

Hi! I'm Richard Shan, a Fab Academy 2024 student at Charlotte Latin School, at Charlotte, NC. I have a pet parakeet and fish!

In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee! I'm actively involved in the local community, helping in hosting tournaments and attending leagues and events every weekend. I currently captain my school and U17 club team, and play for a nationally ranked U20 team.
