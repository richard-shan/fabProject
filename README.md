# Richard Shan - Fab Academy

Welcome to my GitLab page! My Fab Academy documentation site be found [**here**](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/students/richard-shan/)! For more information about the GitLabs environment, visit my documentation for [**setting up GitLabs**](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/charlotte/students/richard-shan/lessons/week1/gitlab/).

My file directory organization system is represented in the following diagram. The [**docs**](https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/academany/fabacademy/2024/labs/charlotte/students/richard-shan/-/tree/main/docs) folder contains all my markdown files for documenting, along with all of the multimedia used in the website. There is a high level of abstraction within the docs folder, as that is where all the documentation is stored. Anything outside the folder is a setup or logistics file that does not appear on the actual webpage.
